# UBHakNight_Spring2019
An Android application app for campus delivery.

Many of the UB students do not have access to vehicle and it is very inconvenience for students to take the Jammed packed weekend shuttle to
get to supermarket and mall from UB.  Our application provide a solution for this problem.

We are an on demand delivery service for UB students.  We aim to deliver all range of needs for UB students for everyday needs.  From food, grocery, kitchen appliances and classroom needs. Our android app allow students to request what they need for a small fee.  These request will be fulfilled in batches by other UB students who wants to make some money while going to shopping themselves.  We will first start with Walmart then wegmans. Continue expanding as population demands.
